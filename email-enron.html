      <h1>Email-Enron Dataset</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Email-Enron dataset represents the email communication network within the 
Enron Corporation. It was made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) during its investigation into the company's financial scandal. The 
dataset contains approximately half a million emails, capturing interactions between 
employees and external parties. 
The dataset is structured as an undirected graph, where: 
● Nodes represent unique email addresses. 
● Edges indicate at least one email exchange between two addresses (i.e., if an 
email was sent from address i to address j, an undirected edge exists 
between them). 
Additionally, non-Enron email addresses appear in the dataset as external nodes 
(acting as sources and sinks), meaning we only observe their communication with 
Enron employees, but not their internal interactions. 
This dataset provides valuable insights into corporate email communication 
patterns, social network structures, and has been widely used for graph-based 
analysis of fraud detection, anomaly detection, and organizational behavior 
modeling.
